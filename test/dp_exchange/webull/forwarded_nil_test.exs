  # **A forwarded `nil` means the caller said nothing, and nothing means the default.**
  #
  # `Keyword.get/3` substitutes its default only for an ABSENT key, never for one present
  # and `nil` — and this family forwards `opts` unchanged through every layer by
  # convention. So `to: nil` arrived here whenever a caller's own caller never set it, and
  # `Keyword.get(opts, :to, self())` handed `nil` on as the subscriber. `Core.Config.opt/3`
  # exists for exactly this and says so; these call sites predated it.
  #
  # The two failure modes were opposite, which is the worst part. In the real `Feed` a `nil`
  # subscriber is silently delivered to nobody — `subscribe/3` answers `:ok` and data never
  # arrives, the failure this family ranks worst. In the fake, `send(nil, _)` raises. So a
  # consumer's tier-1 tests could not have shown them the real behaviour even by accident.
  #
  # Tested against a PROBE standing in for the feed process: it answers the call and
  # reports what it was handed. What changed is the client-side resolution of `:to`, so
  # that is exactly what is measured — no socket, no venue, no timing.
