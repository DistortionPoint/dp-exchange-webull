  A public call answers on the feed's own timeout, not `GenServer.call/2`'s default.

  Split out of `feed_test.exs` for wall clock. This test must block a live feed for longer
  than the five-second default it is proving is no longer in force, so six seconds of
  waiting is the substance of it rather than slack that could be trimmed. ExUnit
  parallelises across FILES and serialises within one, so sitting beside ninety other tests
  meant those six seconds ran end to end instead of alongside them.

      # under test queues behind it on the real mailbox. Six seconds is chosen to sit between
      # the two timeouts: comfortably past the five-second default that used to fire, and
      # nowhere near the fifteen the call is now allowed.
